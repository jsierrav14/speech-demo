  <h1>The greenhouse effect</h1>



  <form>
    <p> The greenhouse effect is the process by which radiation from a planet's atmosphere warms the planet's surface to
      a temperature above what it would be without this atmosphere.[1][2]
    </p>
    <p>
      Radiatively active gases (i.e., greenhouse gases) in a planet's atmosphere radiate energy in all directions. Part
      of this radiation is directed towards the surface, warming it.[3] The intensity of the downward radiation – that
      is, the strength of the greenhouse effect – will depend on the atmosphere's temperature and on the amount of
      greenhouse gases that the atmosphere contains.
    </p>

      Earth's natural greenhouse effect is critical to supporting life, and initially was a precursor to life moving out
      of the ocean onto land. Human activities, however, mainly the burning of fossil fuels and clearcutting of forests,
      have accelerated the greenhouse effect and caused global warming.[4]

    </p>
    <p>
      The planet Venus experienced runaway greenhouse effect, resulting in an atmosphere which is 96% carbon dioxide,
      with surface atmospheric pressure roughly the same as found 900 m (3,000 ft) underwater on Earth. Venus may have
      had water oceans, but they would have boiled off as the mean surface temperature rose to the current 735 K (462
      °C; 863 °F).[5][6][7]

    </p>
    <p>
      The term "greenhouse effect" continues to see use in scientific circles and the media despite being a slight
      misnomer, as an atmosphere reduces radiative heat loss[8] while a greenhouse blocks convective heat loss.[2] The
      result, however, is an increase in temperature in both cases.[9][10]
